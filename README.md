# Description
## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the project.
- `plots/`: Contains the plots generated by the project.
- `report/`: Contains the report of the project and all its resources.

## Technologies
The project is developed using the following technologies:
- `Python 3.11`: The main programming language used to build and run the pipelines and to analyze the data.
- `R`: The programming language used to download the data from TCGA.

## Requirements
### Python
The Python's dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### R
The R's requirements are self-contained in the `download_data.R` file and are installed automatically when the script is run.
